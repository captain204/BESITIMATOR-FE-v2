          Important Liability Statement
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-4">
          Whilst we will do our best (that is to use reasonable care and skill)
          in providing building estimates, the building estimator provided on
          this website and via our online plugin tools are estimates only, and
          you must only use them on this basis and only for personal
          (non-business) use.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base mb-4">
          The service works on the basis of analysing construction work items in
          relation with their unique material and labour requirements, other
          environmental and physical factors that may come into play.
          Construction work items may differ in a number of ways which are not
          taken into account, such as the standard of construction, nature of
          the project, and general condition or specific location.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base mb-4">
          Also, the estimates are, by their nature, subjective and based on
          estimating and experience needs at the time (and markets can change
          for various reasons). The estimates may be relied on as “estimates”
          which means an approximate calculation which may be lower or higher
          than the actual required.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base mb-4">
          The estimates suggested herein may be relied on for construction
          purposes as long as it is deemed an “estimate”. However, we still
          strongly recommend that you seek or consult a registered quantity
          surveyor or request through our premium service to get a more
          realistic and applicable material and labour requirement for your
          construction project (and in fact, it is recommended that you speak to
          more than one agent to compare estimations).
        </p>

        <p className="text-base mb-4">
          The estimations are provided for your use only, and you may not
          encourage or allow any other person to rely on them. We shall not be
          liable for any losses you or anyone else suffers as a result of
          relying on the estimates. This includes not being liable for any loss
          of profit, loss of bargain, loss of capital through over-payment or
          under-sale, or for any indirect, special, or consequential loss. We
          cannot and do not guarantee that our website and online tools will be
          constantly available or error-free.
